"typedef int (&rifii) (int, int)"

The typedef keyword is used to create alias "rifii" for the reference to a function that returns an integer and takes exactly two parameters, both being integers.

This can be useful when we want to simplify complex declarations and using references makes the code more readable, unlike pointers, references always point to a valid location.
